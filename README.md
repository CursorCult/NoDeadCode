# NoDeadCode

ROT equals LIES. You're not a liar, are you?

**Install**

```sh
pipx install cursorcult
cursorcult link NoDeadCode
```

Rule file format reference: https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules#rulemd-file-format

**When to use**

- You want the codebase to mean what it says.
- You’re tired of refactors haunted by unused paths.
- You want every line to earn its keep.

**What it enforces**

- No dead, unused, or unreachable code exists.
- No commented‑out “maybe later” code.
- Every line either matters or is removed.

**Credits**

- Developed by Will Wieselquist. Anyone can use it.
